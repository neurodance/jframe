## Cognitive Science Foundation

### 1. Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988)
**Principle**: Working memory can only hold 7±2 items
**Application**: Jotts limit complexity to digestible chunks
- Max 5 key points per card
- Visual hierarchy guides attention
- Progressive disclosure for details

### 2. Dual Coding Theory (Paivio, 1971)
**Principle**: Information processed through visual + verbal channels is retained 6x better
**Application**: Every Jott combines:
- Visual elements (images, charts, icons)
- Text elements (headlines, bullets, captions)
- Spatial organization (cards, layouts)

### 3. Picture Superiority Effect (Nelson et al., 1976)
**Principle**: Pictures remembered 65% after 3 days vs 10% for text
**Application**: Jotts prioritize visual communication
- Hero images for context
- Infographics over paragraphs
- Icons for quick scanning

### 4. Miller's Law of Chunking (1956)
**Principle**: Information grouped into chunks is easier to process
**Application**: Jott structure enforces chunking
- Card-based layouts
- Sections with headers
- Bullet points vs paragraphs
- Fact sets for data

### 5. Serial Position Effect (Murdock, 1962)
**Principle**: First and last items remembered best
**Application**: Jott templates optimize for memory
- Strong opening cards
- Key takeaway at end
- Important info at boundaries

### 6. Von Restorff Effect (1933)
**Principle**: Distinctive items are remembered better
**Application**: Jotts stand out in feeds
- Rich media vs text posts
- Interactive vs static
- Structured vs stream-of-consciousness
