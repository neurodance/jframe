# Sanity Checks & Cautionary Advice

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Top Risks to Avoid

### 1. The "Build Everything" Trap
**Risk**: Trying to build all features simultaneously
**Reality Check**: You have:
- Multiple forked repos to maintain
- Complex AI integrations
- Privacy/ethics requirements
- Developer ecosystem to build

**Sanity Check**:
```
‚úÖ Can ONE person use ONE feature successfully?
If no ‚Üí You're building too much at once
```

**Recommendation**:
- Start with ONE agent (note-to-self)
- Make it PERFECT
- Then add the second

### 2. The "Mind Reading" Complexity Explosion
**Risk**: Context engine becomes too complex to debug
**Example**:
```typescript
// This looks smart but is a nightmare
const context = await Promise.all([
  getBrowserHistory(),
  getCalendar(),
  getEmail(),
  getLocation(),
  getCognitiveState(),
  getRelationships(),
  // ... 20 more sources
]);
```

**Sanity Check**:
```
‚úÖ Can you explain why the AI made a decision in 1 sentence?
If no ‚Üí Your context system is too complex
```

**Recommendation**:
- Start with 2-3 context sources MAX
- Add more only after users request them
- Always have fallback behavior

### 3. The "Perfect Privacy" Paralysis
**Risk**: Making privacy so strict nothing works
**Reality**: Users will trade some privacy for massive value

**Sanity Check**:
```
‚úÖ Would YOU use this with the current privacy settings?
‚úÖ Can it do something useful with ZERO permissions?
If both no ‚Üí You're over-engineering privacy
```

**Recommendation**:
- Start with local-only features (no privacy risk)
- Add cloud features with clear value proposition
- Let users choose their comfort level

### 4. The ".jtt Format" Over-Engineering
**Risk**: Creating a format so complex no one uses it

**Bad Example**:
```yaml
# 500 lines of configuration...
# 20 required fields...
# Complex inheritance system...
```

**Sanity Check**:
```
‚úÖ Can a developer create their first agent in 5 minutes?
If no ‚Üí Your format is too complex
```

**Recommendation**:
```yaml
# Minimum viable .jtt
agent:
  name: "Simple Note"
  trigger: "note {text}"
  action: "save_note"
# That's it! 4 lines.
```

### 5. The "AI Magic" Disappointment
**Risk**: Promising mind-reading, delivering autocomplete
**User Expectation**: "It knows what I'm thinking!"
**Reality**: "It guesses based on patterns"

**Sanity Check**:
```
‚úÖ Does it work correctly 80% of the time?
‚úÖ Is the 20% failure graceful and fixable?
If no ‚Üí Lower expectations or improve accuracy
```

**Recommendation**:
- Under-promise, over-deliver
- Show confidence scores
- Make correction easy
- Learn from mistakes

## üéØ Critical Success Factors

### 1. The "Mom Test"
**Question**: Could your mom use this without help?

**Check**:
- Install in < 1 minute
- First Jott in < 30 seconds
- No manual required

### 2. The "Delete Test"
**Question**: If users deleted it, would they miss it?

**Check**:
- Week 1: "Interesting toy"
- Week 2: "Actually useful"
- Week 3: "Can't live without it"

### 3. The "Creepy Test"
**Question**: Does it feel creepy or helpful?

**Check**:
```typescript
// Creepy
"I noticed you didn't email your mom back.
I've drafted a response based on your usual style."

// Helpful
"You have a draft reply to Mom from yesterday.
Would you like to review it?"
```

## üìã Incremental Release Strategy

### Phase 0: Foundation (You Are Here)
**Goal**: Working prototype
**Success**: YOU can create a Jott by voice

**DON'T**:
- Add multiple agents
- Build marketplace
- Implement all privacy features

**DO**:
- One perfect feature
- Local only
- Simple voice command

### Phase 1: Alpha (10 Users)
**Goal**: Core functionality works
**Success**: Friends use it daily

**Sanity Checks**:
- [ ] 5-minute setup
- [ ] Zero crashes per day
- [ ] One "wow" moment

### Phase 2: Beta (100 Users)
**Goal**: It's actually useful
**Success**: Organic growth starts

**Sanity Checks**:
- [ ] 50% weekly retention
- [ ] <10 second response time
- [ ] Clear value proposition

### Phase 3: Launch (1000 Users)
**Goal**: Product-market fit
**Success**: Users recommend it

**Sanity Checks**:
- [ ] Net Promoter Score > 50
- [ ] Support burden manageable
- [ ] Revenue path clear

## üö´ What NOT to Build Yet

### Don't Build These Until Phase 3+:
1. **Marketplace** - You need agents first
2. **Monetization** - You need users first
3. **Enterprise features** - You need PMF first
4. **Cross-platform** - Perfect one platform first
5. **AI fine-tuning** - Use existing models first

### Don't Optimize These Early:
1. **Performance** - Make it work, then make it fast
2. **Scale** - 100 users don't need Kubernetes
3. **Security** - Local-first = less attack surface
4. **Internationalization** - English first
5. **Accessibility** - Core features first (but keep in mind)

## ‚úÖ Weekly Sanity Checks

### Every Monday Ask:
1. **What's the ONE thing users need this week?**
2. **What can I cut without anyone noticing?**
3. **Am I building features or solving problems?**

### Every Friday Ask:
1. **Did I ship something usable?**
2. **Did I learn something from users?**
3. **Am I closer to product-market fit?**

## üéØ The "Minimum Lovable Product"

### What Makes It Lovable (Not Just Viable):

**Week 1 Goal**:
```
User: "Jott note buy milk"
App: Creates note instantly
User: "Neat!"
```

**NOT Week 1**:
```
User: "Jott note buy milk"
App: "Analyzing context... checking calendar...
      inferring shopping patterns... predicting store..."
User: "Um, I just wanted a note"
```

## üîç Technical Debt Awareness

### Acceptable Debt (Pay Later):
- Hardcoded configurations
- Basic error messages
- Simple UI
- Manual processes
- Inefficient algorithms (if fast enough)

### Unacceptable Debt (Fix Now):
- Security vulnerabilities
- Privacy leaks
- Data loss bugs
- Crashes
- Broken core features

## üìä Metrics That Matter

### Track These:
1. **Time to First Jott** (target: <30 seconds)
2. **Daily Active Users** (not just installs)
3. **Jotts per User per Day** (engagement)
4. **Voice Success Rate** (core feature)

### Ignore These (For Now):
1. Total downloads
2. Page views
3. Time in app
4. Feature requests
5. Competition

## üí° Final Wisdom

### The 80/20 Rule
- 80% of value comes from 20% of features
- Find that 20%
- Perfect it
- Ignore the rest (for now)

### The "Boring" Success Path
1. One user (you) loves it
2. Ten users like it
3. Hundred users use it
4. Thousand users need it
5. Ten thousand users pay for it

### Red Flags You're Off Track:
- "Just one more feature then we launch"
- "The AI needs to be perfect"
- "Let's rebuild with better architecture"
- "We need more context sources"
- "The format isn't flexible enough"

### Green Flags You're On Track:
- "Users figured it out without help"
- "They're using it differently than expected (but it works)"
- "This one feature is enough for now"
- "Let's ship it and learn"
- "Good enough for v1"

## Remember

**Perfect is the enemy of shipped.**

Your biggest risk isn't building something bad.
It's building something nobody wants.

Ship early, learn fast, iterate quickly.

The best Jott is the one that exists.
